# Multi-Splay-Trees
- Multi Splay tree is an advanced binary search tree with a competitive bound for O(log log n). It is a complex data
structure made by combining more than one splay trees to form a single binary search tree for better access time.
- Tested the tree for various search sequences and modifying the number of nodes in each sequence using C. Analysed
the run-time for each sequence.
